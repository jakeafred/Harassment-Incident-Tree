### CSE 111: Database Systems Project

Develop a web app to track reported harassment messages throughout social media and mobile networks while collecting data on who receives these types of messages to formulate possible relations between the victims. This database could be used as a reference for law enforcement to possibly identify anonymous offenders through victim connections.
